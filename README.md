The Odin Project: Etch-A-Sketch

This will be a cross between a sketchpad, etch-a-sketch. I plan on
implementing the following features to this project:

* Two write modes, etch-a-sketch and sketchpad. Etch-a-sketch will
basically be a sketchpad that is always "on", or follows the cursor
printing the selected color. Sketchpad mode will require the user to
click to paint to a grid item.
* Sketchpad will present a trailing cursor effect. I'd like this to
outline the grid item and fade over a certain duration after the user
exits the grid item. While sitting on an item it would be cool to make
a kind of fade-in-fade-out kind of animation
* Either mode I'd like to implement basic image operations like a flip
and rotation. Maybe inverted colors or other color effects, might be too
much math, def worth looking into though
* Color picker, random colorizer, maybe a fading effect wherein the user
selects a starting and ending color and the sketchpad tracks the pathing
from start to finish, providing a gradient effect on mouseup or something
* Maybe implement some kind of save feature, or maybe like a history where
a user could save a snapshot of their image to a list on screen or something
